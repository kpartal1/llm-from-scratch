# LLM From Scratch In Rust

### Credits

The code in this project is translated from the book [*Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)*](https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-large-language-model-from-scratch) by Sebastian Raschka.

This project is a work in progress. "From Scratch" is a bit of an overstatement becaue I am using the tch crate's libtorch bindings. Seems a bit over-the-top to reimplement torch when it's the industry standard.
